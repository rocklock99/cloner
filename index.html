    <h1>Cloner</h1>
    <p>You will store your clones as an array of objects. <br>
        You must utilize the Spread Operator to make your clones (...). <br>
        The only thing about your clone (each object) that changes is the id. <br>
        You can use Victor or your own pet's image.</p>

    <h2>Use the filter method and a select box to remove the clones that didn't turn out right.</h2>
